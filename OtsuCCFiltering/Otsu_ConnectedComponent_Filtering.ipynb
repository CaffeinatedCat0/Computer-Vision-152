    "\n",
    "In this problem we will play with convolution filters. Filters, when convolved with an image, will respond strongest on locations of an image that look like the filter when it is rotated by 180 degrees. This allows us to use filters as object templates in order to identify specific objects within an image. In the case of this assignment, we will be finding cars within an image by convolving a car template onto that image. Although this is not a very good way to do object detection, this problem will show you some of the steps necessary to create a good object detector. The goal of this problem will be to teach some pre-processing steps to make vision algorithms be successful and some strengths and weaknesses of filters. Each problem will ask you to analyze and explain your results. If you do not provide an explanation of why or why not something happened, then you will not get full credit.\n",
